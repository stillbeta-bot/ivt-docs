The IVT Dashboard provides a centralized view of all visitor activity, detection events, and system performance across your surveillance network. Use it to identify trends, monitor real-time traffic, and generate reports for stakeholders.

## Dashboard Overview

When you open the Dashboard, you are presented with a summary of key metrics collected from all connected cameras and detection engines. The layout is organized into cards that surface the most important data at a glance.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Visitor Count" icon="users">
    Total unique visitors detected across all cameras within the selected time period.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Detection Events" icon="eye">
    Number of face detection events, including matched and unmatched detections.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Gallery Matches" icon="address-book">
    Count of detections that matched a face in one of your configured galleries.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Active Cameras" icon="video">
    Real-time status of cameras currently streaming and processing video feeds.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Visitor Count Metrics and Trends

The visitor count panel tracks unique individuals detected by your cameras over time. The system uses FaceVACS AI to deduplicate detections, ensuring the same person appearing on multiple cameras is counted only once.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Daily View">
    Displays an hourly breakdown of visitor counts for the selected day. Use this view to identify peak traffic hours and allocate resources accordingly.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Weekly View">
    Aggregates visitor data by day across a seven-day window. Useful for spotting day-of-week patterns in foot traffic.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Monthly View">
    Shows daily totals across the full month. This view is ideal for long-term trend analysis and monthly reporting.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  Hover over any data point on the trend chart to see the exact visitor count and timestamp for that interval.

## Detection Analytics

The detection analytics section breaks down all face detection events by type, confidence level, and source camera.

**Key metrics include:**

- **Total Detections** -- The raw number of faces detected across all feeds.
- **Matched Detections** -- Faces that correspond to entries in your common or frequent galleries.
- **Unmatched Detections** -- Faces detected that do not match any gallery entry.
- **Average Confidence Score** -- The mean matching confidence across all gallery matches.

<Info>
  Detection analytics are updated in near real-time. There may be a delay of up to 30 seconds between a detection event and its appearance on the dashboard.
