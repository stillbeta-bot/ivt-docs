This guide covers the most common issues encountered on the IVT Platform and provides step-by-step solutions. If your issue is not listed here, contact your reseller or the platform support team for assistance.

## Login Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cannot log in with correct credentials">
    **Symptoms:** The login page rejects valid credentials or displays a generic error message.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify you are using the correct email address (check for typos and ensure the correct case).
    2. Reset your password using the "Forgot Password" link on the login page.
    3. Clear your browser cache and cookies, then try again.
    4. Ensure your account has not been deactivated by your administrator.
    5. If two-factor authentication is enabled, verify your authenticator app is synced with the correct time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Two-factor authentication code not working">
    **Symptoms:** The 2FA code is rejected even though it appears correct.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Ensure your device's clock is accurate. TOTP codes are time-sensitive and even a 30-second drift can cause failures.
    2. Wait for a new code cycle and try the fresh code immediately.
    3. If you have lost access to your authenticator app, contact your administrator to reset 2FA on your account.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Account locked after multiple failed attempts">
    **Symptoms:** A message indicates the account is temporarily locked.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Wait 15 minutes for the lockout period to expire, then try again with the correct credentials.
    2. If you cannot remember your password, use the "Forgot Password" flow after the lockout expires.
    3. Contact your administrator if the lockout persists beyond the expected duration.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Camera Connection Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Camera shows as offline in the dashboard">
    **Symptoms:** A camera that was previously working now shows an offline or disconnected status.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify the camera is powered on and connected to the network.
    2. Check that the camera's IP address has not changed (relevant for ONVIF cameras with DHCP).
    3. Ensure the FMU device connected to the camera is online.
    4. For Eagle Eye Networks cameras, verify the camera is online in the EEN dashboard.
    5. Restart the camera and wait 2-3 minutes for it to reconnect.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Live video feed not loading">
    **Symptoms:** The live view shows a black screen, loading spinner, or error message.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Check your browser supports the required video codecs (H.264 is recommended).
    2. Disable browser extensions that may block video playback (ad blockers, privacy extensions).
    3. Verify your network allows WebSocket connections, as live video uses WebSocket-based streaming.
    4. Try a different browser to rule out browser-specific issues.
    5. If using a VPN, try disconnecting it -- some VPNs interfere with video streaming.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Camera not discovered during ONVIF scan">
    **Symptoms:** The camera does not appear in the ONVIF discovery results.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Confirm the camera supports ONVIF Profile S.
    2. Ensure the FMU and the camera are on the same network subnet, or that multicast traffic is routed between subnets.
    3. Check that ONVIF is enabled in the camera's settings (some manufacturers disable it by default).
    4. Try adding the camera manually by IP address instead of relying on auto-discovery.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## FMU Device Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="FMU device showing offline">
    **Symptoms:** The FMU device appears offline in the dashboard and is not processing video.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify the FMU device is powered on and the status LEDs indicate normal operation.
    2. Check the network cable connection and verify the device has a valid IP address.
    3. Ensure the FMU can reach the platform's API endpoints (outbound HTTPS on port 443).
    4. Restart the FMU device by power cycling it. Wait 3-5 minutes for it to reconnect.
    5. If the device remains offline, check for firmware updates that may resolve connectivity issues.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="FMU not processing facial recognition">
    **Symptoms:** The FMU is online but no facial detections or matches appear.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify that at least one camera is assigned to the FMU and is streaming video.
    2. Check that the company has an active facial recognition license.
    3. Ensure galleries are configured and contain at least one enrolled subject.
    4. Verify the camera angle and lighting provide clear facial captures (faces should be at least 80 pixels wide in the frame).
    5. Review the FMU's processing logs from the device management page for error messages.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Search Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Search not returning expected results">
    **Symptoms:** A facial search returns no matches or misses known subjects.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify the search image is clear, well-lit, and shows the face at a near-frontal angle.
    2. Check that the subject is enrolled in the appropriate gallery and that the gallery is active.
    3. Adjust the similarity threshold -- a threshold that is too high may exclude valid matches.
    4. Ensure the date and time range of the search covers the period when the subject was present.
    5. Verify the correct cameras and sites are selected in the search filters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Search takes too long to complete">
    **Symptoms:** Search results take several minutes to return or time out.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Narrow the date range to reduce the volume of data being searched.
    2. Select specific cameras instead of searching all cameras.
    3. Ensure FMU devices are online and responsive, as search queries are processed on the edge devices.
    4. For very large deployments, consider breaking the search into multiple smaller queries.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Webhook Delivery Failures

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhooks not being delivered">
    **Symptoms:** The webhook log shows failed deliveries or the endpoint is not receiving requests.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify the webhook endpoint URL is correct and accessible from the public internet.
    2. Ensure the endpoint returns a 2xx HTTP status code within 10 seconds.
    3. Check that the endpoint's SSL certificate is valid (the platform does not send webhooks to endpoints with invalid certificates).
    4. Review the webhook logs for specific HTTP error codes that indicate the cause of failure.
    5. If the webhook was automatically disabled due to consecutive failures, re-enable it after fixing the endpoint.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Webhook payloads arriving with incorrect data">
    **Symptoms:** The payload structure or content does not match expectations.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify you are parsing the JSON payload correctly (check Content-Type header handling).
    2. Review the webhook event type configuration to ensure you are subscribed to the correct events.
    3. Check the [Webhooks documentation](/integrations/webhooks) for the current payload schema.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## White-Label Script Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Script fails during AWS infrastructure phase">
    **Symptoms:** The `create-white-label.mjs` script exits with AWS permission or resource errors.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify the AWS credentials have sufficient IAM permissions for S3, CloudFront, ACM, EC2, and ELB.
    2. Check that the target AWS region is correct and the services are available in that region.
    3. If a resource already exists with the same name, the script may fail on conflict. Use `--dry-run` to identify the conflict before re-running.
    4. Review the script's error output for the specific AWS API error code and message.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="ACM certificate validation stuck">
    **Symptoms:** The script is waiting for certificate validation but it never completes.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify the DNS CNAME records for certificate validation are correctly configured at your DNS provider.
    2. Allow up to 30 minutes for DNS propagation, especially if using a provider with slower propagation times.
    3. Use `dig` or `nslookup` to confirm the validation CNAME record resolves correctly.
    4. If validation fails, cancel and re-run with `--aws-only` to request a new certificate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Color generation produces poor results">
    **Symptoms:** The auto-generated color palette does not look good or has contrast issues.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Ensure the input primary color has sufficient saturation (avoid very dark, very light, or highly desaturated colors).
    2. Run the script with `--dry-run` to preview the generated palette before committing.
    3. After generation, manually adjust individual tokens in the `config.ts` file if specific colors need refinement.
