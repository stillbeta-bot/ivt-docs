## Overview

The Search Setup Wizard provides a guided, multi-step workflow for configuring real-time
monitoring sessions. Rather than filling in a single complex form, the wizard walks you
through each configuration decision in sequence -- from naming the session to selecting
cameras, galleries, and notification recipients -- ensuring that every required setting is
addressed before the session launches.

<Note>
  The wizard is specifically designed for **real-time monitoring** sessions, where the platform
  continuously analyzes live camera feeds and generates alerts as faces are detected and
  matched. For searching previously recorded footage, use the
  [Historic Footage Search](/features/search/historic-footage) workflow instead.

## Wizard Steps

The setup wizard consists of five sequential steps. You must complete each step before
proceeding to the next.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Initial Setup">
    Select the search type and provide basic session details:

    - **Search type** -- choose **Real-Time** to create a live monitoring session
    - **Session name** -- assign a descriptive name to identify this session in your
      dashboard (e.g., "Lobby Entrance Monitoring" or "Warehouse Night Shift")

    The session name appears in alerts, reports, and the active sessions list, so choose
    something meaningful to your team.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Select Users to Notify">
    Choose which team members should receive alerts generated by this monitoring session:

    - Browse or search the list of users in your organization
    - Select one or more users who will receive real-time notifications
    - Selected users will be alerted via their configured notification channels (email,
      push notification, or in-app alert)

    <Tip>
      Select only the users who need to act on alerts from this session. Over-notifying
      team members can lead to alert fatigue and missed critical events.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Configure Settings">
    Define the core detection and matching parameters for the session:

    - **Cameras** -- select which cameras to include in this monitoring session
    - **Detection threshold** -- set the minimum confidence score required to trigger a match
    - **Galleries** -- choose which face galleries to match detected faces against
    - **Alert rules** -- define the conditions that generate notifications (e.g., match found
      in a specific gallery, unknown face detected, or frequency-based triggers)

    <Info>
      Higher detection thresholds reduce false positives but may miss legitimate matches.
      A threshold of 75-85% provides a good balance for most deployments. High-security
      scenarios may warrant thresholds of 90% or above.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: Confirmation">
    Review all configured settings before launching the session:

    - Session name and type
    - List of notified users
    - Selected cameras and galleries
    - Detection threshold and alert rules

    Verify each setting carefully. Once confirmed, the monitoring session begins immediately
    and will start processing live feeds from the selected cameras.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5: Decline Info">
    If you cancel the wizard at any point, this step displays a summary of what was not
    configured and the implications of cancelling. No monitoring session is created, and
    no changes are saved. You can restart the wizard at any time to begin a new setup.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Reference

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Camera Selection">
    You can select any combination of ONVIF and Eagle Eye cameras that are currently online
    and assigned to your organization. Cameras that are offline or in an error state will
    appear grayed out and cannot be selected.

    | Consideration | Recommendation |
    |---|---|
    | Camera count | Select only the cameras relevant to the monitored area |
    | Camera quality | Prefer cameras with higher resolution for better match accuracy |
    | Processing load | Each additional camera increases FMU processing demand |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Gallery Selection">
    Choose one or more galleries to match detected faces against. The gallery type determines
    the alert behavior:

    - **Common galleries** -- matches trigger standard identification alerts
    - **Frequent galleries** -- matches identify repeat visitors
    - **Ignored galleries** -- matches suppress alerts for known individuals

    You can combine multiple gallery types in a single session for layered detection logic.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Alert Rules">
    Define when and how alerts are generated:

    - **On match** -- alert when a detected face matches a gallery entry
    - **On unknown** -- alert when a face is detected that does not match any gallery
    - **Cooldown period** -- minimum time between repeated alerts for the same individual
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Name Sessions Descriptively">
    Use names that include the location, purpose, or shift (e.g., "Main Entrance - Day Shift").
    This makes it easy to identify sessions in the dashboard and in alert notifications.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Limit Notification Recipients">
    Only notify users who have a direct operational role in responding to alerts. Security
    operators, front-desk staff, and shift supervisors are typical recipients.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test Before Full Deployment">
    Create a short test session with a single camera and a small gallery to validate your
    detection threshold and alert rules before rolling out to all cameras.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review and Adjust Regularly">
    After launching a session, monitor the alert volume and accuracy for the first few hours.
    Adjust the detection threshold or gallery selection if you observe too many false positives
    or missed detections.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Launching a real-time monitoring session immediately begins processing live video feeds.
  Ensure that your FMU devices have sufficient processing capacity for the number of cameras
  selected. Overloading an FMU can degrade detection performance across all active sessions.
</Warning>
