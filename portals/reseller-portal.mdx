The Reseller Portal provides reseller-level administrators with the tools to manage their company accounts, allocate licenses, handle billing, and support their end customers. Resellers operate under a distributor in the platform hierarchy and serve as the direct point of contact for company administrators.

## Overview

Resellers are organizations that sell and support the IVT Platform to end-customer companies. The Reseller Portal gives these partners the ability to manage their client base and ensure successful deployments.

```
Super Admin
  └── Distributor
        └── Reseller (You are here)
              └── Companies
```

<Note>
  Reseller Portal access is available to users with the Reseller Admin or Reseller Viewer role. These roles are provisioned by the parent distributor during reseller setup.
</Note>

## Dashboard

The Reseller Portal dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of your operations:

- **Total companies** managed under your reseller account
- **Active FMU devices** across all companies and their health status
- **License utilization** showing allocated, in-use, and available licenses
- **Recent activity** including new company registrations, device events, and alerts
- **Support tickets** and pending action items
- **Billing summary** for the current period

## Managing Companies

Company management is the core function of the Reseller Portal:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Company">
    Navigate to **Companies > Add Company**. Enter the company name, address, primary contact, and administrator email. The company admin receives an invitation to complete onboarding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Licenses">
    Allocate licenses from your reseller pool to the new company. Specify the license type and quantity based on the company's subscription agreement.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Company Settings">
    Set the company's feature permissions, data retention policies, and integration access. These settings define what capabilities are available to the company.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy FMU Devices">
    Assign FMU devices to the company from the available device inventory. Coordinate physical installation and verify device connectivity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor and Support">

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  After creating a company, walk the company administrator through the initial setup process. A successful onboarding experience reduces support requests and improves customer retention.

## License Management

The Reseller Portal provides tools for managing license allocations across your companies:

    View your total license allocation from the parent distributor. The pool shows total licenses, licenses assigned to companies, and available licenses remaining for new assignments.

  <Tab title="Company Allocations">
    See a breakdown of licenses assigned to each company. Identify underutilized licenses that could be reallocated and companies approaching their limits.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="License History">
    Review a chronological log of all license changes including allocations, revocations, and adjustments with timestamps and the user who made the change.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

  Licenses can be reclaimed from a deactivated company and reassigned to another. Navigate to the company's license settings and click **Revoke** to return licenses to your pool.
