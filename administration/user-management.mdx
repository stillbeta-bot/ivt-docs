## Overview

User management in the IVT Platform allows administrators to control who has access to the
platform, what actions they can perform, and which resources they can view. You can invite
new team members, assign roles, manage pending invitations, and remove users who no longer
require access.

<Note>
  User management capabilities depend on your portal context. Company admins manage users
  within their company, reseller admins manage users across their reseller account, and
  distributor admins manage users at the distributor level.
</Note>

## Viewing Team Members

Navigate to **Administration > Users** to view all active team members. The user list
displays the following information for each member:

- **Name** -- the user's full name
- **Email** -- the login email address
- **Role** -- the assigned permission role
- **Status** -- active or pending invitation
- **Last active** -- the most recent login timestamp

<Tip>
  Use the search bar and role filter to quickly find specific team members, especially
  in organizations with large user bases.
</Tip>

## Inviting New Users

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Invitation Form">
    Navigate to **Administration > Users** and click the **Invite User** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter User Details">
    Provide the following information:
    - **Email address** -- the email where the invitation will be sent
    - **First name** and **Last name** -- the user's identity
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign a Role">
    Select the appropriate role for the new user. Available roles depend on your portal
    type (company, reseller, or distributor). See the [Managing User Roles](#managing-user-roles)
    section for details on each role.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the Invitation">
    Click **Send Invitation**. The user will receive an email with a link to create their
    account and set a password.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  Invitations expire after a defined period. If the recipient does not accept the invitation
  in time, you can resend it from the pending invitations list.
</Info>

## Managing User Roles

Roles define the permissions and access level for each user. The available roles vary based
on the portal context.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Company Roles">
    | Role | Description |
    |---|---|
    | **Company Admin** | Full access to company settings, cameras, devices, zones, and user management |
    | **Operator** | Access to cameras, live feeds, and detection events; cannot modify settings or manage users |
    | **Viewer** | Read-only access to dashboards and detection events |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Reseller Roles">
    | Role | Description |
    |---|---|
    | **Reseller Admin** | Full access to reseller account, company management, licensing, and billing |
    | **Reseller Support** | Access to company details and device management; cannot manage billing or licenses |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Distributor Roles">
    | Role | Description |
    |---|---|
    | **Distributor Admin** | Full platform access including reseller management, licensing, and billing |
    | **Distributor Support** | Access to reseller and company details; limited administrative capabilities |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  Assign the **Admin** role only to trusted individuals. Admin users have full control over
  settings, user management, and resource configuration within their portal scope.
</Warning>

## Viewing Pending Invitations

Pending invitations are listed in a separate tab or section within the user management page.
Each pending invitation shows:

- **Email address** of the invited user
- **Role** assigned to the invitation
- **Sent date** -- when the invitation was issued
- **Expiration status** -- whether the invitation is still valid

You can perform the following actions on pending invitations:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Resend Invitation" icon="paper-plane">
    Send a new invitation email to the user. This is useful if the original email was
    lost or the invitation has expired.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Revoke Invitation" icon="ban">
    Cancel the invitation before the user accepts it. The invitation link will be
    invalidated immediately.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Removing Users

To remove a user from the platform:

1. Navigate to **Administration > Users** and locate the user.
2. Click the user's entry to open their detail view.
3. Click the **Remove User** or **Deactivate** button.
4. Confirm the action in the dialog prompt.

<Warning>
  Removing a user revokes their access immediately. The user will be logged out of any
  active sessions and will no longer be able to sign in. This action does not delete
  historical activity logs or detection events associated with the user.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I restore a removed user?">
    Removed users cannot be restored directly. To re-grant access, send a new invitation
    to the user's email address. They will need to accept the invitation and may need to
    create a new account.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens to a removed user's configurations?">
    Detection rules, zone configurations, and other settings created by the removed user
    remain intact. These are associated with the company or organization, not the
    individual user account.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
