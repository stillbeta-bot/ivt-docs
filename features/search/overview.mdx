---

The IVT Platform provides three distinct search modes, each designed for a specific investigative workflow. All search capabilities are powered by the FaceVACS AI engine, delivering high-accuracy facial recognition across your entire camera network.

## Search Modes

IVT offers three complementary approaches to finding people across your surveillance infrastructure. Choose the mode that best fits your investigation scenario.

  <Card title="Historic Footage" icon="clock-rotate-left" href="/features/search/historic-footage">
    Search through recorded video archives to locate specific individuals or review past events within a defined time range.

  <Card title="Real-Time Search" icon="satellite-dish" href="/features/search/real-time-search">
    Monitor live camera feeds with active facial recognition to detect persons of interest as they appear.

## When to Use Each Search Type

Selecting the right search mode ensures you get results efficiently. The table below outlines the primary use case, data source, and response time for each mode.

| Search Mode        | Best For                                  | Data Source           | Response Time       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Historic Footage** | Reviewing past incidents, forensic analysis | Recorded archives     | Minutes to hours    |
| **Real-Time**        | Active monitoring, immediate alerts        | Live camera feeds     | Sub-second          |
| **Photo Search**     | Locating a known individual across footage | Reference image + archives | Minutes         |

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Investigation Workflow">
    When investigating a past incident, start with **Historic Footage Search** to narrow down the time window and cameras involved. Once you identify a person of interest, use **Photo Search** to find all other appearances of that individual across your network.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Surveillance Workflow">
    For active threat monitoring, configure **Real-Time Search** on your entry-point cameras. Combine it with face galleries to receive immediate alerts when a person of interest is detected on any live feed.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Identification Workflow">
    When you have a photo of a person but need to determine their activity history, use **Photo Search** to scan all recorded footage. The AI engine will return all matching detections ranked by confidence score.

## Cognetic FaceVACS Engine

All search modes are powered by the **Cognetic FaceVACS** facial recognition engine — a commercial biometric platform that runs locally on each FMU device. FaceVACS does not operate in the cloud; all face detection and matching is performed on-premise by the FMU's local FaceVACS VideoScan instance.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Face Detection">
    The engine automatically locates and extracts faces from video frames, regardless of angle, lighting conditions, or partial occlusion. Detection operates at up to 30 frames per second per camera stream.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Feature Extraction">
    Each detected face is converted into a compact biometric template -- a mathematical representation of the face's unique features. These templates are used for all subsequent matching operations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Face Matching">
    The matching algorithm compares biometric templates against galleries or reference images and returns results ranked by confidence score. Matching thresholds are configurable per search and per gallery.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Liveness and Quality Scoring">
    The engine assigns a quality score to each detection, factoring in resolution, pose angle, blur, and illumination. Low-quality detections can be automatically filtered to improve result accuracy.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  FaceVACS processes biometric templates, not raw images, during matching operations. This approach ensures high-speed comparisons even when searching across millions of stored detections.

## How Search Processing Works

Understanding where processing occurs is important for evaluating the platform's security and performance characteristics.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Real-Time Search">
    In real-time monitoring, the entire detection and matching pipeline runs **on the FMU device**:

    1. Camera streams video via RTSP to the FMU's Camera Capture Service (CCS)
    2. CCS extracts frames and sends them to the Video Scan Consumer
    3. The Video Scan Consumer submits frames to the local FaceVACS engine via SOAP API
    4. FaceVACS detects faces, generates templates, and matches against locally stored galleries
    5. Match results are published to RabbitMQ and delivered to the cloud platform
    6. The cloud platform triggers notifications to subscribed users

    Video frames never leave the local network. Only lightweight detection metadata (thumbnails, match scores, timestamps) is transmitted to the cloud.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Historic & Photo Search">
    Historic and photo searches are coordinated by the cloud but processed on FMU devices:

    1. The user uploads a probe image or selects a time range in the cloud interface
    2. The cloud distributes the search request to the relevant FMU device(s) via RabbitMQ
    3. Each FMU generates a biometric template from the probe using its local FaceVACS instance
    4. FaceVACS searches against stored detection templates on the device
    5. Results are returned to the cloud and aggregated for display

    This distributed processing model means search performance scales with the number of deployed FMU devices rather than cloud compute capacity.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  Because all biometric processing happens on isolated FMU devices, each company's facial recognition data is physically separated. An FMU assigned to Company A has no access to Company B's galleries or detection data. See [How It Works](/getting-started/how-it-works) for the full architecture.
</Info>

## Search Permissions

Access to search features is controlled by role-based permissions. Administrators can configure which user roles have access to each search mode.

<Note>
  Users must have the **Search** permission enabled in their role to access any search functionality. Individual search modes (Historic, Real-Time, Photo) can be enabled or disabled independently per role. Contact your system administrator if you do not see a search mode you need.
</Note>

## Common Search Settings

Several settings apply across all search modes and can be configured globally or per-search.

- **Confidence Threshold** -- The minimum matching score (0-100) required for a result to be included. Higher thresholds reduce false positives but may miss lower-quality matches.
- **Camera Selection** -- Choose specific cameras or camera groups to include in the search scope. Narrowing the camera set reduces search time.
- **Face Quality Filter** -- Set minimum quality requirements for detections included in results. This filters out blurry or partially occluded faces.
- **Result Limit** -- Define the maximum number of results returned per search to manage performance and review time.

<Tip>
  For most use cases, a confidence threshold between 70 and 85 provides a good balance between recall and precision. Adjust based on your environment's lighting and camera quality.
