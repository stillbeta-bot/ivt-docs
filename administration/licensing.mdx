## Overview

The IVT Platform uses a license-based model to control access to features and services.
Licenses determine which capabilities are available to each company, how many cameras and
devices can be activated, and which recognition engines are enabled. License management is
handled at the distributor and reseller levels, with allocations flowing down to individual
companies.

<Note>
  Licenses are purchased through your distributor or reseller and allocated to companies
  within the platform hierarchy. Each license unlocks specific functionality and is tied
  to a company or device.

## How Licensing Works

Licenses are distributed through the platform hierarchy and activated at the company or
device level.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Procurement">
    Distributors acquire licenses from IVT and add them to their available license pool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Allocation to Resellers">
    Distributors allocate licenses from their pool to resellers based on customer needs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assignment to Companies">
    Resellers assign licenses from their allocated pool to individual companies.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activation">
    Licenses are activated at the company level. For FMU-specific licenses such as FaceVACS,
    activation occurs on the device itself during the FMU activation step.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Viewing License Status

Navigate to **Administration > Licensing** to view the current license inventory. The
licensing dashboard displays:

- **Total licenses** -- the number of licenses in your pool
- **Allocated licenses** -- licenses assigned to resellers or companies
- **Available licenses** -- unallocated licenses ready for assignment
- **Active licenses** -- licenses currently in use on devices or by companies
- **Expiring soon** -- licenses approaching their expiration date

<Tip>
  Monitor the licensing dashboard regularly to ensure you have sufficient licenses for
  upcoming deployments. Set up notifications to alert you when licenses are nearing
  expiration.
</Tip>

## FaceVACS License Activation on FMU Devices

FaceVACS licenses are a specialized license type that must be activated on a specific FMU
device to enable the facial recognition engine.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Activation Process">
    1. Ensure the FMU device is enrolled and assigned to a company.
    2. Navigate to the FMU device detail page.
    3. Select **Activate License** and choose an available FaceVACS license.
    4. The license is bound to the device and the FaceVACS engine starts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="License Transfer">
    A FaceVACS license can be transferred from one FMU to another. First, deactivate the
    license on the current device, then activate it on the target device. Only one device
    can use a license at any given time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="License Expiration">
    When a FaceVACS license expires, the recognition engine on the associated FMU device
    stops processing. The device remains connected but will not perform facial identification
    until a new or renewed license is activated.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  FaceVACS license activation requires the FMU device to be online and connected to the
  platform. Ensure the device has a stable network connection before initiating the
  activation process.
</Warning>

<Info>
  License counts and availability are updated in real time. After assigning or revoking
  a license, the dashboard reflects the change immediately.
