## Overview

Companies are the primary organizational units in the IVT Platform. Each company represents
a customer organization that uses the platform for facial recognition and video surveillance.
Companies are created and managed by resellers or distributors within the platform hierarchy,
and each company has its own set of users, cameras, devices, zones, and detection rules.

<Note>
  The IVT Platform uses a hierarchical structure: **Distributors** manage **Resellers**,
  and **Resellers** manage **Companies**. Your ability to create and configure companies
  depends on your role within this hierarchy.
</Note>

## Company Hierarchy

Understanding the platform hierarchy is essential for effective company management.

## Creating a Company

Resellers and distributors can create new companies from the administration panel.

    Go to **Administration > Companies** and click the **Create Company** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Company Information">
    Fill in the required company details:
    - **Company name** -- the legal or display name of the organization
    - **Contact email** -- the primary email address for the company
    - **Phone number** (optional) -- a contact phone number
    - **Address** -- the company's primary physical address
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Billing Address">
    Enter the billing address if it differs from the primary address. This address will
    appear on invoices and billing correspondence.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Resources">
    Allocate initial resources to the company:
    - **Licenses** -- assign available licenses from your pool
    - **FMU devices** -- assign enrolled devices to the company
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and Confirm">
    Review the company configuration and click **Save**. The new company will appear in
    your company list and is ready for user invitations and camera setup.

</Info>

## Managing Billing Address

Each company has a billing address used for invoicing and payment processing. The billing
address can be set during company creation or updated at any time.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Setting Billing Address">
    During company creation, enter the billing address in the designated section. If the
    billing address is the same as the physical address, you can copy it directly.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Updating Billing Address">
    Navigate to the company detail page, click **Edit**, and update the billing address
    fields. Changes apply to all future invoices generated for the company.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Assigning Cameras and Devices

Resources such as cameras and FMU devices are assigned to companies by resellers or
distributors. This determines which hardware a company can use for its surveillance operations.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Assigning Eagle Eye Cameras">
    Eagle Eye cameras are linked through the Eagle Eye Networks integration. Once the
    company's Eagle Eye account is connected, cameras are automatically synchronized.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Assigning ONVIF Cameras">
    ONVIF cameras are added directly by the company administrator or assigned by the
    reseller. Each camera must be configured with the correct network settings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Assigning FMU Devices">
    FMU devices are assigned to companies during the device enrollment process or through
    the device management interface. Each FMU can only be assigned to one company at a time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Reassigning a device or camera from one company to another will remove all existing
  associations, including zone assignments and detection rules. Plan resource transfers
  carefully to avoid service disruption.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Maintain an up-to-date record of resource assignments across your companies. Regularly
  review the company detail pages to ensure that licenses, devices, and cameras are
  allocated appropriately.
