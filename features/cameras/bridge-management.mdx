## Overview

Bridges are network gateway devices that connect camera subnets to the IVT Platform. They
serve as intermediaries between your on-premise camera infrastructure and the cloud platform,
routing video streams and management commands across network boundaries. Bridges are
particularly relevant in deployments that integrate with Eagle Eye Networks or span multiple
network segments.

<Note>
  A bridge is not the same as an FMU device. While FMU devices perform on-device facial
  recognition, bridges focus on network connectivity -- ensuring that camera streams from
  isolated subnets are accessible to the platform and to FMU devices that need to process
  them.
</Note>

## Viewing Connected Bridges

Navigate to your company's bridge management section to view all registered bridge devices.
The bridge list displays each device along with its current status and connection details.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Bridge Status" icon="signal">
    Each bridge reports its connectivity state: **Online** (actively routing traffic),
    **Offline** (unreachable), or **Degraded** (experiencing connectivity issues).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Connected Cameras" icon="camera">
    View the list of cameras accessible through each bridge. This shows which camera
    subnets the bridge is serving and how many streams are actively routed.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Bridge Details

Selecting a bridge from the list displays its full configuration and operational details.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **IP Address** | The network address of the bridge device |
| **Status** | Current connectivity state (Online, Offline, Degraded) |
| **Firmware Version** | The software version running on the bridge hardware |
| **Connected Cameras** | Number and list of cameras routed through this bridge |
| **Last Heartbeat** | Timestamp of the most recent status report from the bridge |
| **Uptime** | Duration since the last bridge restart |

## Configuring Bridge Settings

Click the **Settings** button on a bridge detail page to open the bridge configuration modal.
Bridge settings control how the device routes traffic and communicates with the platform.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Bridge Settings">
    Navigate to the bridge detail page and click the **Settings** icon or button to open
    the configuration modal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Network Parameters">
    Adjust the bridge's network settings, including routing rules, port assignments, and
    connection timeouts as needed for your network topology.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and Apply">
    Click **Save** to apply the updated configuration. The bridge will apply the new settings
    and may briefly reconnect to the platform.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Bridges and Camera Integrations

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Eagle Eye Networks">
    Bridges play a central role in Eagle Eye Networks integrations. The Eagle Eye bridge
    device connects your local camera network to the Eagle Eye cloud, which in turn
    integrates with the IVT Platform. The bridge handles video routing, bandwidth
    management, and local storage for Eagle Eye-connected cameras.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="ONVIF Cameras">
    For ONVIF camera deployments across multiple subnets, bridges enable FMU devices to
    access cameras that are not on the same local network segment. The bridge routes
    RTSP streams from the camera subnet to the FMU's subnet, enabling facial recognition
    processing without direct network adjacency.

## Bridge Health Monitoring

The platform continuously monitors bridge health through periodic heartbeat signals and
connectivity checks.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Heartbeat Monitoring">
    Each bridge sends regular heartbeat messages to the platform. If a heartbeat is missed,
    the bridge status transitions to **Offline** and an alert may be generated for the
    system administrator.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Throughput Metrics">
    Monitor the data throughput passing through each bridge to identify bandwidth bottlenecks.
    High throughput with many connected cameras may indicate that the bridge hardware or
    network link is approaching capacity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Firmware Updates">
    Bridge firmware can be updated remotely through the platform when new versions are
    available. Firmware updates may include security patches, performance improvements,
    and new feature support.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bridge Shows Offline">
    Verify that the bridge hardware is powered on and connected to the network. Check that
    the bridge can reach the platform's cloud endpoints. Firewall rules or proxy
    configurations may block outbound traffic from the bridge.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cameras Not Visible Through Bridge">
    Ensure that the cameras are on a subnet that the bridge is configured to serve. Verify
    that the bridge's routing rules include the camera subnet and that no firewall rules
    block traffic between the camera network and the bridge.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Intermittent Connectivity">
    Intermittent bridge connectivity is often caused by network instability, insufficient
    bandwidth, or hardware issues. Review the bridge's heartbeat history to identify
    patterns. Consider upgrading the network link or replacing the bridge hardware if
    the issue persists.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Losing bridge connectivity will interrupt video streams for all cameras routed through
  that bridge. Plan bridge maintenance during off-peak hours and ensure redundant network
  paths where possible to minimize surveillance downtime.
</Warning>
