## Overview

Field Management Units (FMUs) are edge computing devices -- typically Intel NUC hardware --
deployed on-premise at your facility. FMUs perform facial recognition processing locally,
eliminating the need to stream video to the cloud for analysis. Each FMU connects to your
local ONVIF cameras and processes video feeds in real time, sending only detection results
and metadata back to the IVT Platform.

<Note>
  FMUs are the backbone of on-premise facial recognition in the IVT Platform. They run
  the FaceVACS recognition engine locally, providing fast, reliable identification without
  depending on cloud connectivity for processing.
</Note>

## Why Edge Computing

FMU devices provide several advantages over purely cloud-based processing architectures.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Low Latency" icon="bolt">
    Facial recognition is performed on-site, delivering sub-second identification results
    without the round-trip delay of cloud processing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Offline Capability" icon="wifi-slash">
    FMUs continue to operate and perform facial recognition even when internet connectivity
    is lost. Detection results are queued and synced when the connection is restored.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bandwidth Efficiency" icon="gauge-high">
    Video streams stay on the local network. Only lightweight detection metadata is transmitted
    to the cloud, significantly reducing bandwidth consumption.

## FMU Lifecycle

Each FMU device follows a defined lifecycle from initial enrollment to active operation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enrollment">
    The FMU device is registered in the IVT Platform. During enrollment, the device receives
    a unique identifier and is prepared for configuration. This step is typically performed
    by a distributor or system administrator.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assignment">
    The enrolled FMU is assigned to a specific company and location. This associates the
    device with the correct tenant and determines which galleries and detection rules it
    will use.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activation">
    The FMU is activated with a valid FaceVACS license, enabling the facial recognition
    engine. Activation also provisions the device with the required configuration and
    gallery data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Operation">
    The FMU is fully operational and processing video feeds from assigned cameras. It
    performs facial detection and recognition in real time and reports results to the
    IVT Platform.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Viewing Device Status and Health

The **FMU Devices** section displays all registered devices along with their current status
and health metrics.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Status Indicators">
    | Status | Description |
    |---|---|
    | **Online** | Device is connected and processing normally |
    | **Offline** | Device is not reachable from the platform |
    | **Pending Activation** | Device is enrolled but not yet activated with a license |
    | **Error** | Device is reporting a fault or configuration issue |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Health Metrics">
    Each FMU reports the following health data:
    - **CPU utilization** -- processing load on the edge device
    - **Memory usage** -- current RAM consumption
    - **Uptime** -- time since last reboot
    - **Last heartbeat** -- timestamp of the most recent communication with the platform
    - **FaceVACS engine status** -- whether the recognition engine is running
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Device Management

Company administrators can manage FMU devices assigned to their organization.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="View Device Details">
    Select an FMU from the device list to view its full configuration, including assigned
    cameras, active license, software version, and connection history.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Assign Cameras to an FMU">
    Each FMU can process streams from one or more ONVIF cameras. Assign cameras by
    navigating to the device detail page and selecting cameras from the available list.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Restart or Reconfigure">
    If an FMU is experiencing issues, you can trigger a remote restart or push updated
    configuration from the platform. This forces the device to re-download its gallery
    data and detection rules.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Decommission a Device">
    When an FMU is no longer needed, it can be decommissioned from the platform. This
    releases the associated license and removes the device from active inventory.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Monitoring Device Connectivity

The IVT Platform monitors each FMU's connectivity through periodic heartbeat signals. If a
device fails to send a heartbeat within the expected interval, its status is updated to
**Offline** and a notification may be triggered.

<Warning>
  An offline FMU will continue to perform local facial recognition if it was operational
  before losing connectivity. However, detection results will not appear in the platform
  until the device reconnects and syncs its queued data.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Deploy FMU devices on a reliable network with a stable power supply. Consider using an
  uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to maintain operation during brief power outages.
  Ensure the device has a static IP address or a reserved DHCP lease.
</Tip>

<Info>
  FMU device management capabilities vary by portal role. Distributors and resellers can
  manage devices across multiple companies, while company administrators can only view
  and configure devices assigned to their organization.
