## Overview

Beyond routine monitoring, the IVT Platform provides a suite of advanced operations for
managing FMU (NUC) devices. These operations allow administrators and distributors to remotely
reboot, repair, clean, transfer, and access devices without requiring physical presence at
the deployment site.

<Warning>
  Several operations on this page are destructive or disruptive. Rebooting interrupts active
  processing, cleaning erases data, and transferring a device removes it from its current
  company. Always confirm the target device and understand the consequences before executing
  these actions.
</Warning>

## Device Operations

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Reboot" icon="power-off">
    Remotely restart the FMU device to resolve software issues or apply pending updates.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Repair" icon="wrench">
    Trigger a remote repair to fix configuration drift, restart failed services, and
    re-synchronize the device with the platform.

  <Card title="Clean" icon="broom">
    Clear cached data and temporary files from the device while preserving database schemas
    and core configuration.

</CardGroup>

### Rebooting a Device

A remote reboot restarts the FMU hardware and all running services. Use this operation when
the device is unresponsive, experiencing degraded performance, or after a software update
that requires a restart.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the Device">
    Navigate to **FMU Devices** and select the target device from the list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate Reboot">
    Click **Reboot** from the device actions menu. Confirm the operation in the dialog.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Restart">
    The device will go offline briefly and return to **Online** status once the reboot
    completes. This typically takes 2 to 5 minutes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Repairing a Device

The repair operation diagnoses and corrects common issues on the FMU, including stalled
recognition services, configuration mismatches, and failed gallery synchronizations. It
re-applies the expected configuration without erasing stored data.

<Note>
  Repair is a non-destructive operation. It restores services and configuration to the
  expected state without removing detection history or gallery data on the device.
</Note>

### Cleaning Device Data

The clean operation removes cached detection data, temporary processing files, and log
archives from the FMU. Database schemas and core configuration are preserved, so the device
remains operational after cleaning.

<Warning>
  Cleaning a device removes locally cached detection events that have not yet been
  synchronized to the platform. Ensure the device has a stable connection and has completed
  any pending sync before running this operation.
</Warning>

## Device Transfer and Detachment

### Transferring a Device

Transfer moves an FMU device from one company to another. This is commonly used by
distributors when reassigning hardware between client organizations.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the Device">
    Navigate to the device detail page for the FMU you want to transfer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Transfer">
    Click **Transfer** from the device actions menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Target Company">
    Choose the destination company from the list of available organizations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Transfer">
    Review the transfer details and confirm. The device will be disassociated from the
    current company and assigned to the new one.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Detaching a Device

Detaching (unattaching) removes an FMU from its associated company without transferring it
to another organization. The device returns to an unassigned state and can be re-enrolled
or reassigned later.

## Remote Access

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="SSH Access">
    The platform can generate a secure SSH link for direct terminal access to an FMU device.
    This is used for advanced troubleshooting, log inspection, and manual configuration that
    cannot be performed through the platform interface.

    To obtain an SSH link, select the device and click **SSH Access** from the actions menu.
    The generated link provides time-limited access to the device shell.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Camera Preview">
    Request a live preview image from any camera connected to the FMU. This is useful for
    verifying camera positioning and image quality without accessing the full video stream.

    Select the device, choose a connected camera, and click **Preview** to retrieve a
    current snapshot.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Device Enrollment

New FMU devices must be enrolled before they can be assigned and activated. Enrollment
registers the device with the platform and provisions it with the necessary credentials.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Install Link">
    From the device management area, click **Get Install Link** to generate a unique
    provisioning URL for the new device.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Installer on Device">
    Access the FMU hardware and open the install link in a browser or execute the provided
    setup script. This registers the device with the platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign to Company">
    Once enrolled, assign the device to a company and location from the platform interface.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Device operations availability depends on your portal role. Distributors and platform
  administrators have access to all operations, while company administrators may only
  have access to reboot and camera preview for devices assigned to their organization.
</Info>

<Tip>
  Schedule maintenance operations such as reboot and clean during off-peak hours to minimize
  disruption to active surveillance and recognition workflows.
