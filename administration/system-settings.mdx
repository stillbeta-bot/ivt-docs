## Overview

System Settings provides centralized configuration for platform-wide preferences,
notification behavior, emergency response integrations, and access to system resources.
Administrators use this section to customize the IVT Platform to meet their operational
and compliance requirements.

<Note>
  Access to system settings requires administrator privileges. Changes made in this
  section may affect all users within your organization or portal scope.
</Note>

## General Configuration

The general settings section covers core platform preferences that apply across your
organization.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Organization Profile" icon="building">
    Update your organization's display name, logo, contact information, and primary
    address. These details appear throughout the platform and on generated reports.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Regional Settings" icon="globe">
    Configure timezone, date format, and language preferences for your organization.
    These settings affect how timestamps, dates, and detection events are displayed.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Notification Settings

Configure how and when the platform sends notifications for detection events, system
alerts, and administrative actions.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Detection Notifications">
    Set up notifications for facial recognition and detection events:
    - **Email alerts** -- receive email notifications when a detection rule triggers
    - **Push notifications** -- receive real-time alerts on mobile devices
    - **In-app notifications** -- view alerts within the platform dashboard
    - **Notification frequency** -- choose between immediate alerts or digest summaries
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="System Alerts">
    Configure alerts for system-level events:
    - **Device offline** -- receive a notification when an FMU device goes offline
    - **Camera disconnected** -- alert when a camera loses connectivity
    - **License expiration** -- warning notifications before a license expires
    - **Storage threshold** -- alert when storage capacity reaches a defined limit
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Administrative Notifications">
    Manage notifications for administrative activities:
    - **New user registration** -- notification when a new user accepts an invitation
    - **Role changes** -- alert when user roles are modified
    - **Configuration changes** -- notification for significant settings modifications
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  Configure notification channels to match your operational workflow. Critical alerts
  like device failures should use immediate email and push notifications, while routine
  events can use daily digest summaries to reduce notification fatigue.
</Tip>

## Emergency Response Settings (RapidSOS)

The IVT Platform integrates with RapidSOS to enable 911 and emergency response capabilities.
When configured, detection events can automatically trigger emergency notifications with
location data and event context.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable RapidSOS Integration">
    Navigate to **System Settings > Emergency Response** and toggle the RapidSOS
    integration to **Enabled**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure API Credentials">
    Enter the RapidSOS API credentials provided by your RapidSOS account representative.
    These credentials authenticate the connection between the IVT Platform and the
    RapidSOS emergency data platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Trigger Rules">
    Specify which detection events should trigger an emergency response. For example,
    configure the system to initiate a RapidSOS alert when a person on a threat
    watchlist is identified.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Location Data">
    Ensure that zone and camera location data is accurate. RapidSOS uses this information
    to provide emergency responders with the precise location of the detected event.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Emergency response integration should be configured and tested carefully. False
  emergency alerts can have serious consequences. Work with your security team and
  local authorities to establish appropriate trigger thresholds and response protocols
  before enabling this feature in production.
</Warning>
