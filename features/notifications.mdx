The IVT Platform delivers real-time notifications to keep your team informed about detection events, system health, and administrative changes. Notifications are accessible via `/system/notifications` across all portals — company, distributor, and reseller.

## Notification Categories

    Automated alerts for device status changes, camera connectivity issues, and license expiration warnings.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Notification Types

The platform emits the following notification event types:

| Event Type | Category | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `face.detected` | Detection | A face has been detected in a camera feed |
| `face.matched` | Detection | A detected face matched an entry in a gallery |
| `face.watchlist_hit` | Detection | A detected face matched a watchlist entry (high priority) |
| `access.granted` | Detection | Access was granted based on facial recognition |
| `access.denied` | Detection | Access was denied — no match or blocked individual |
| `device.online` | System | An FMU device has come online |
| `device.offline` | System | An FMU device has gone offline |
| `camera.connected` | System | A camera feed has been successfully connected |
| `camera.disconnected` | System | A camera feed has been disconnected or lost |
| `alert.created` | System | A new system-level alert has been generated |
| `gallery.updated` | Administrative | A gallery has been modified (subjects added, removed, or updated) |

<Warning>
  `face.watchlist_hit` notifications are treated as critical alerts and bypass mute/snooze settings by default. This ensures threat detections are never silently suppressed.
</Warning>

## Delivery Channels

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="In-App">
    Notifications appear in the bell icon dropdown within the platform header. Unread counts are displayed as a badge. Clicking a notification navigates directly to the relevant event or resource.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Email">
    Email notifications are sent to the user's registered email address. Detection alerts include a thumbnail of the matched face and a direct link to the search result. Email delivery supports batching to prevent inbox flooding during high-activity periods.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="SMS">
    SMS notifications are available for critical alerts such as watchlist hits and device offline events. SMS delivery requires a verified phone number in the user's profile settings.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Webhook">
    Webhook delivery posts a JSON payload to a configured endpoint URL. This channel is ideal for integrating IVT alerts into third-party SIEM systems, SOC dashboards, or custom automation workflows.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuring Notification Preferences

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to notification settings">
    Go to **System > Notifications** and click the **Preferences** tab in the top-right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select notification categories">
    Toggle which categories you want to receive: Detection, System, and Administrative. Each category can be independently enabled or disabled.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose delivery channels per category">
    For each enabled category, select one or more delivery channels — in-app, email, SMS, or webhook. Different categories can use different channels.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set severity thresholds">
    Configure minimum severity levels for each channel. For example, send SMS only for critical watchlist hits while routing all detection events to email.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save preferences">
    Click **Save** to apply your notification configuration. Changes take effect immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Notification History and Filtering

The notification history view provides a chronological log of all notifications delivered to your account. Use the filter controls to narrow results:

- **By type** — Select one or more event types (e.g., `face.matched`, `device.offline`)
- **By date range** — Specify a start and end date for the notification window
- **By read status** — Toggle between all, unread only, or read only
- **By severity** — Filter by informational, warning, or critical severity levels

<Tip>
  Use the **Mark all as read** action to clear your unread count after reviewing a batch of notifications.
</Tip>

## Muting and Snoozing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Muting notifications">
    Muting silences all non-critical notifications for a specific category or source. Navigate to **Preferences > Mute Rules** to configure mute rules by category, device, or camera. Muted notifications are still logged in the history but do not trigger delivery.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Snoozing notifications">
    Snoozing temporarily pauses notifications for a defined duration — 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, or until end of day. Click the **Snooze** button in the notification dropdown to activate. Snoozed notifications are queued and delivered as a summary when the snooze period expires.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Mute and snooze rules do not apply to `face.watchlist_hit` notifications at the critical severity level. These alerts are always delivered immediately to ensure security responsiveness.
</Note>

## Role-Based Notification Visibility

Notification visibility is governed by the user's role and portal level:

| Role | Detection Alerts | System Alerts | Administrative |
|---|---|---|---|
| Company Admin | All company events | All company devices | Full access |
| Company Operator | Assigned cameras only | Assigned devices only | Limited (own account) |
| Distributor Admin | Aggregated across companies | All managed devices | Company management events |
| Reseller Admin | Aggregated across distributors | All managed devices | Distributor and company events |
| Platform Admin | Full platform visibility | Full platform visibility | Full access |

<Info>
  Users only receive notifications for resources within their permission scope. A company operator assigned to specific cameras will not receive detection alerts from other cameras in the same company.
