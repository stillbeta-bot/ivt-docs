## Overview

Beyond basic gallery creation and face enrollment, the IVT Platform provides advanced
operations for managing gallery content at scale. These operations include copying images
between galleries, activating and deactivating galleries, searching within gallery contents,
editing image metadata, and managing gallery limits.

## Copying Images Between Galleries

You can copy face entries from one gallery to another without re-uploading the original
images. This is useful when an individual needs to appear in multiple galleries -- for
example, moving a person from a Frequent gallery to a Common gallery for active tracking.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the Source Image">
    Navigate to the gallery containing the face entry you want to copy. Click on the
    individual's profile to open the detail view.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Copy Dialog">
    Click the **Copy to Gallery** action to open the copy image modal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose the Target Gallery">
    Select the destination gallery from the list of available galleries. You can copy to
    any gallery type (Common, Frequent, or Ignored) within your organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm the Copy">
    Review the source and target galleries and click **Confirm**. The face entry, including
    all reference photos and biometric templates, is duplicated in the target gallery.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Copying creates an independent entry in the target gallery. Changes made to the copy
  do not affect the original entry, and vice versa.
</Note>

## Gallery Activation and Deactivation

Galleries can be activated or deactivated to control whether they participate in facial
recognition matching.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Activation">
    Activating a gallery makes it available for matching in real-time monitoring and search
    sessions. Activation may require a valid license assignment depending on your subscription
    tier. When a gallery is activated, its biometric templates are distributed to the relevant
    FMU devices.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Deactivation">
    Deactivating a gallery removes it from active matching without deleting its contents.
    Deactivated galleries retain all face entries and metadata, but are excluded from
    recognition processing. This frees up license capacity and reduces FMU processing load.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  Deactivate galleries that are not currently needed rather than deleting them. This
  preserves your curated face data and allows rapid reactivation when required.
</Tip>

## Searching Within Galleries

Use the gallery search function to locate specific individuals within a gallery by matching
a face image against the gallery contents.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Search by Image" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Upload a face photo to search for matching entries across one or more galleries. The
    system returns all entries that exceed the configured similarity threshold.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Search by Metadata" icon="tag">
    Filter gallery entries by name, tags, or notes to quickly locate specific individuals
    without performing a biometric comparison.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Gallery Types

The platform supports three gallery types, each designed for a distinct operational purpose.

| Type | Purpose | Population Method |
|---|---|---|
| **Common** | Track and identify specific persons of interest | Manual enrollment |
| **Frequent** | Identify individuals who appear repeatedly across cameras | Automatic system detection |
| **Ignored** | Suppress alerts for known individuals (staff, regulars) | Manual enrollment |

## Gallery Limits

Each gallery and organization is subject to configurable capacity limits that govern how
many face entries can be stored.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Per-Gallery Limits">
    Each gallery has a maximum number of face entries determined by your subscription tier
    and license allocation. When a gallery reaches its limit, new entries cannot be added
    until existing entries are removed or the limit is increased.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Per-Company Limits">
    Your organization has an overall limit on the total number of gallery entries across all
    galleries. This limit is tied to your active license count and subscription plan.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Checking Current Usage">
    View your current gallery usage and remaining capacity on the gallery overview page. Each
    gallery displays its entry count alongside the configured maximum.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Approaching or exceeding gallery limits may prevent automatic enrollment in Frequent
  galleries. Monitor your usage regularly and contact your distributor to increase limits
  if your operational needs grow.
</Warning>

## Bulk Operations

### Bulk Gallery Updates

Administrators can apply changes across multiple galleries in a single operation. Bulk
updates support modifying activation status, matching thresholds, and alert configurations
for selected galleries simultaneously.

### Image Metadata Editing

Each face entry supports editable metadata fields that help organize and identify individuals.

- **Name** -- the display name for the gallery entry
- **Tags** -- categorical labels for filtering and grouping (e.g., "VIP," "Contractor")
- **Notes** -- freeform text for additional context about the individual

To edit metadata, open the face entry detail view and click **Edit**. Update the desired
fields and save your changes.

<Info>
  Metadata changes are propagated to FMU devices during the next gallery synchronization
  cycle. Biometric templates are not affected by metadata edits, so recognition accuracy
  remains unchanged.
