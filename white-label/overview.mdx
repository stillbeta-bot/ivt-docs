The IVT Platform supports full white-label customization, allowing partners to deploy the platform under their own brand identity. White-labeling transforms the look, feel, and identity of the platform so that end users experience it as a product of the partner organization rather than IVT.

## What Is White-Labeling?

White-labeling in the IVT Platform means replacing all visible brand elements -- logos, colors, product names, URLs, and legal text -- with those of the partner organization. The underlying functionality remains identical, but the visual presentation is fully customized.

<Info>
  White-label brands are configured at the platform infrastructure level. Each brand operates on its own domain, with its own visual identity, while sharing the same backend services and data architecture.
</Info>

## Available Brands

The platform ships with several pre-configured brands:

| Brand | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Verify** | The default IVT Platform brand | Default |
| **EEN** | Eagle Eye Networks branded deployment | Partner |
| **Totalplay** | Totalplay telecommunications branded deployment | Partner |
| **Eye-D** | Eye-D security branded deployment | Partner |

Each brand is a complete visual identity package that includes colors, logos, typography choices, and branded assets.

## What Can Be Customized

White-label customization covers every user-facing aspect of the platform:

## Color Token System

The platform's visual identity is driven by 11 color tokens. All UI components reference these tokens, ensuring a consistent brand experience across every page and component.

| Token | Purpose | Example Usage |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `primary` | Main brand color | Buttons, links, active states |
| `primaryHover` | Hover state of primary elements | Button hover, link hover |
| `primaryLight` | Light tint of primary color | Backgrounds, badges, highlights |
| `primaryDark` | Dark shade of primary color | Text on light backgrounds, borders |
| `secondary` | Complementary brand color | Secondary buttons, accents |
| `background` | Page background color | Main content area, panels |
| `surface` | Surface/card background | Cards, modals, dropdowns |
| `text` | Primary text color | Body text, headings |
| `textSecondary` | Secondary text color | Captions, placeholders, metadata |
| `border` | Border and divider color | Input borders, table dividers, card outlines |
| `error` | Error and danger states | Error messages, destructive actions |

<Tip>
  When creating a new brand, you only need to provide the primary color. The automated brand creation script generates the remaining 10 tokens using a color algorithm that ensures proper contrast ratios and accessibility compliance.
</Tip>

## Logo Requirements

Each white-label brand requires the following logo files:

| Logo File | Format | Dimensions | Usage |
|-----------|--------|------------|-------|
| Full logo (light) | SVG or PNG | 200x50px min | Sidebar, navigation (dark backgrounds) |
| Full logo (dark) | SVG or PNG | 200x50px min | Sidebar, navigation (light backgrounds) |
| Icon only | SVG or PNG | 48x48px | Collapsed sidebar, mobile header |
| Login logo | SVG or PNG | 300x80px min | Login and registration pages |
| Email header | PNG | 200x50px | Email notification headers |
| Favicon (16px) | ICO/PNG | 16x16px | Browser tab icon |
| Favicon (32px) | ICO/PNG | 32x32px | Browser tab icon (high DPI) |
| Apple touch icon | PNG | 180x180px | iOS home screen shortcut |
| Open Graph image | PNG | 1200x630px | Social media link previews |
| Loading spinner | SVG/GIF | 64x64px | Application loading states |

<Warning>
  Logo files must be provided before the brand creation script is executed. Missing logo files will cause the build process to fail. Prepare all 10 logo assets in advance.
</Warning>

## Brand Configuration Architecture

Each brand is defined by a configuration file that specifies all customization values. The configuration is consumed by both the frontend application and the CI/CD pipeline:

```
brands/
  ├── verify/          # Default brand
  │   ├── config.ts    # Color tokens, metadata, URLs
  │   ├── config.cjs   # CommonJS version for build tools
  │   └── assets/      # Logos, icons, spinner
  ├── een/             # Eagle Eye Networks brand
  ├── totalplay/       # Totalplay brand
  └── eye-d/           # Eye-D brand
```

The frontend application reads the brand configuration at build time and injects the appropriate colors, logos, and metadata into the compiled application.

## Benefits for Partners

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Complete Brand Ownership">
    End users see only the partner's brand throughout the entire experience. There is no visible reference to IVT Platform in the white-labeled deployment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Independent Deployment">
    Each brand is deployed on its own domain with its own SSL certificate and CDN distribution. Partners maintain full control over their deployment URL.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Automated Setup">
    The brand creation process is automated through a script that handles frontend configuration, backend setup, and AWS infrastructure provisioning. See [Creating a Brand](/white-label/creating-a-brand) for details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consistent Updates">
    White-label brands receive the same platform updates as the default brand. New features and bug fixes are automatically applied to all brand deployments.
