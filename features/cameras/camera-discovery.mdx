## Overview

Camera Discovery allows you to automatically find ONVIF-compatible IP cameras on your local
network without manually entering each camera's connection details. The IVT Platform leverages
your deployed FMU (NUC) devices to scan the local subnet for cameras that support the ONVIF
protocol, returning detailed information about each discovered device.

<Note>
  Camera Discovery relies on your FMU device being connected to the same network segment as
  the cameras you want to find. The FMU broadcasts ONVIF discovery probes (WS-Discovery) on
  its local subnet and collects responses from compatible devices.
</Note>

## How Network Scanning Works

When you initiate a camera discovery scan, the platform instructs a selected FMU device to
perform a network-level probe. The FMU sends multicast WS-Discovery messages across its
local subnet and listens for responses from ONVIF-compliant devices. Each responding camera
reports its capabilities, connection details, and hardware information.

  <Card title="Subnet Scanning" icon="network-wired">
    The FMU scans its local network segment using ONVIF WS-Discovery. Only cameras on the
    same subnet or reachable via configured network routes will respond to the probe.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Device Identification" icon="camera-cctv">
    Each discovered camera returns its manufacturer, model, firmware version, available
    RTSP streams, and network address -- giving you all the information needed to add it
    to the platform.

## Discovering Cameras

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to ONVIF Cameras">
    Go to **Cameras > ONVIF** from the main navigation menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Find Cameras Dialog">
    Click the **Find Cameras** button to open the camera discovery modal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the FMU Device">
    Choose the FMU (NUC) device that will perform the network scan. Select the device that
    is connected to the same network segment as the cameras you want to discover.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for the Scan to Complete">
    The FMU scans the local subnet for ONVIF devices. This typically takes 10 to 30 seconds
    depending on network size and the number of responding devices.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Discovered Cameras">
    The scan results display all detected cameras with the following details:

    | Field | Description |
    |---|---|
    | **IP Address** | The camera's network address on the local subnet |
    | **Port** | The ONVIF service port reported by the camera |
    | **Manufacturer** | The camera hardware manufacturer |
    | **Model** | The specific camera model identifier |
    | **RTSP URL** | The discovered streaming endpoint for the camera |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Selected Cameras">
    Select one or more discovered cameras from the results list and click **Add** to register
    them in the platform. The discovered connection details are pre-populated automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Discovery vs. Manual Addition

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Automatic Discovery">
    - Pre-populates IP address, port, manufacturer, model, and RTSP URL from the scan results
    - Ideal when deploying multiple cameras at once on the same network
    - Requires an FMU device on the same subnet as the target cameras
    - Discovers all responding ONVIF cameras in a single operation
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual Addition">
    - You enter all connection details by hand (IP, port, credentials, RTSP URL)
    - Suitable for cameras on remote subnets not reachable by the FMU scan
    - Useful when adding a single camera with known connection parameters
    - Required for cameras that do not support ONVIF WS-Discovery
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  After adding cameras via discovery, you will still need to provide authentication credentials
  (username and password) for each camera. Discovery identifies cameras on the network but
  cannot retrieve device credentials.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No Cameras Found">
    If the scan returns no results, verify that the FMU device and cameras are on the same
    network subnet. Cameras on different VLANs or behind routers will not respond to the
    multicast discovery probe unless your network is configured to forward WS-Discovery traffic.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="ONVIF Disabled on Camera">
    Some cameras ship with the ONVIF service disabled by default. Access the camera's web
    administration interface and enable ONVIF under the network or integration settings.
    Restart the camera after enabling the service.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Firewall Blocking Discovery">
    Network firewalls or camera-level firewalls may block WS-Discovery multicast traffic
    (UDP port 3702). Ensure that this port is open between the FMU device and the camera
    network segment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="FMU Device Offline">
    The selected FMU must be online and connected to the platform to perform a scan. Verify
    the device status on the **FMU Devices** page before initiating discovery.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Camera Discovery exposes all ONVIF-compatible devices on the scanned subnet. In shared
  network environments, you may discover cameras belonging to other tenants or departments.
  Only add cameras that your organization owns and is authorized to monitor.
</Warning>
