## Overview

The IVT Platform provides integrated billing and invoice management for all levels of the
platform hierarchy. Invoices are generated based on license usage, device activations, and
service subscriptions. Payment processing is handled through Stripe, providing secure and
reliable transaction management.

<Note>
  Billing visibility depends on your role in the platform hierarchy. Distributors see
  billing across all resellers, resellers see billing for their companies, and company
  administrators see only their own invoices.
</Note>

## Viewing Invoices

Navigate to **Administration > Billing** to access the invoice management interface.
Each invoice entry includes:

- **Invoice number** -- unique identifier for the invoice
- **Date** -- the billing period or issue date
- **Amount** -- the total amount due or paid
- **Status** -- current payment status (paid, pending, overdue, or failed)
- **Company / Reseller** -- the entity the invoice is associated with

<Tip>
  Use the date range filter and status filter to narrow down the invoice list. This is
  especially helpful for distributors and resellers managing billing across many accounts.
</Tip>

## Invoice Hierarchy

Invoices flow through the platform hierarchy, reflecting the organizational structure of
your deployment.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Distributor Level">
    Distributors receive consolidated invoices that cover all reseller accounts and any
    directly managed companies. These invoices reflect the total license and service usage
    across the entire distribution network.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reseller Level">
    Resellers receive invoices for the companies they manage. Each reseller invoice
    itemizes license allocations and service usage per company.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Company Level">
    Companies receive invoices for their direct platform usage, including active licenses,
    device activations, and any additional service charges.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Payment Integration with Stripe

The IVT Platform integrates with Stripe for secure payment processing. Stripe handles
credit card transactions, automatic payment retries, and receipt generation.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Secure Payments" icon="shield-check">
    All payment transactions are processed through Stripe's PCI-compliant infrastructure.
    Card details are never stored on IVT Platform servers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automatic Billing" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Recurring charges are processed automatically based on your billing cycle. Failed
    payments are retried according to the configured retry schedule.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  To update your payment method, navigate to **Administration > Billing** and select
  **Payment Methods**. You will be redirected to a secure Stripe-hosted page to enter
  or update your card details.
</Info>

## Billing Address Management

Each company and reseller has a billing address that appears on invoices and payment
receipts. The billing address can be configured during company creation or updated at
any time.

To update a billing address:

1. Navigate to **Administration > Billing** or the company settings page.
2. Click **Edit Billing Address**.
3. Update the address fields (street, city, state/province, postal code, country).
4. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

<Warning>
  Changes to the billing address apply to future invoices only. Previously generated
  invoices retain the billing address that was active at the time of generation.
</Warning>

financial records.
