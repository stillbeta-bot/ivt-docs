<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Real-Time Search">
    Monitor live camera feeds and receive instant facial recognition matches against your enrolled galleries. Get notified the moment a person of interest appears on any connected camera.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Historic Footage Analysis">
    Search through recorded video footage to locate specific individuals or events. Specify date ranges, cameras, and zones to narrow results across days, weeks, or months of archived footage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Photo-Based Person Search">
    Upload a photograph and search across all connected cameras to find when and where that person has appeared. The platform uses AI-powered facial recognition to match faces across your entire camera network.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Face Gallery Management">
    Build and maintain collections of known faces organized into galleries. Use galleries for watchlist alerting, access control enforcement, VIP identification, and blocklist management.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Zone-Based Geofencing">
    Define logical zones that group cameras by physical location, building, floor, or any organizational boundary. Apply policies and run searches scoped to specific zones for targeted monitoring.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Camera Integration">
    Connect cameras from multiple sources including Eagle Eye Networks cloud-managed cameras and ONVIF-compliant devices. Manage all feeds from a single unified interface.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edge Computing with FMU Devices">
    Deploy Facial Matching Unit (FMU) edge devices on-premises for low-latency facial recognition processing. FMUs handle AI inference locally and sync results with the cloud platform.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multi-Tenant Architecture">
    Operate across a hierarchical multi-tenant structure that supports distributors, resellers, and individual companies. Each level inherits policies and permissions from its parent while maintaining data isolation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
