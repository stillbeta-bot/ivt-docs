description: "Manage primary contact information for your organization"

## Overview

Each company in the IVT Platform can designate a primary contact person. This individual
serves as the main point of contact for the organization in matters related to system
administration, emergency notifications, billing correspondence, and technical support. The
contact person record is referenced across the platform whenever communication with the
organization is required.

<Note>
  The contact person is distinct from individual user accounts. While multiple users may have
  access to the platform, the contact person represents the single authoritative point of
  contact for the organization as a whole.
</Note>

## Setting Up Contact Information

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Company Settings">
    Go to **Settings > Company** or access your organization's profile from the administration
    panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Contact Person Dialog">
    Click the **Contact Person** section or the **Edit** button next to the current contact
    information to open the contact person modal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Contact Details">
    Fill in the following fields:

    - **Full name** -- the contact person's first and last name
    - **Email address** -- primary email for correspondence and notifications
    - **Phone number** -- direct phone number for urgent communications
    - **Role / Title** -- the contact person's position within the organization

  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Contact Information">
    Click **Save** to store the contact details. The information takes effect immediately
    across all platform communication channels.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editing Contact Details

To update the contact person or modify existing contact information, reopen the contact
person modal from the company settings and update the relevant fields. All changes are
saved immediately and reflected in subsequent platform communications.

<Tip>
  Keep the contact person information up to date, especially the email address and phone
  number. Outdated contact details can delay critical emergency notifications and support
  responses.
</Tip>

## How Contact Information Is Used

The contact person record is referenced throughout the platform in several operational
contexts.

<CardGroup cols={2}>

    routed to the contact person's email and phone number to ensure rapid response.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Billing Correspondence" icon="file-invoice">
    License renewals, subscription changes, and billing inquiries are directed to the
    contact person as the organization's administrative representative.
  </Card>
  <Card title="System Alerts" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Platform-level notifications such as scheduled maintenance windows, service updates, and
    policy changes are communicated to the designated contact person.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Technical Support" icon="headset">
    When support cases are opened, the contact person is included in correspondence to
    maintain organizational awareness of ongoing issues and resolutions.
  </Card>

## RapidSOS Integration

The IVT Platform integrates with RapidSOS to deliver emergency contact information to first
responders. When an emergency event is triggered through the platform, the contact person's
details may be transmitted to RapidSOS to facilitate rapid coordination with law enforcement
or emergency services.

<Info>
  RapidSOS integration availability depends on your subscription tier and geographic region.
  Contact your distributor to verify whether this feature is enabled for your organization.
</Info>

## Contact Person Per Company

Each company in the platform hierarchy maintains its own contact person record. In
multi-tenant deployments, this ensures that communications are routed to the correct
organization.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Company Administrators">
    Company administrators can view and update the contact person for their own organization.
    Only users with administrative privileges can modify the contact record.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Distributors and Resellers">
    Distributors and resellers can view and manage contact person records for all companies
    under their management. This enables centralized contact administration across the
    client portfolio.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  The contact person's email address and phone number may be shared with external emergency
  services through the RapidSOS integration during critical events. Ensure that the
  designated contact person is aware of this and consents to having their information
  used for emergency response purposes.
</Warning>
