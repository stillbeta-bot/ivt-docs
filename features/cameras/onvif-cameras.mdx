## Overview

ONVIF cameras are on-premise IP cameras that comply with the Open Network Video Interface Forum
(ONVIF) standard. Unlike cloud-connected cameras, ONVIF devices are installed and managed on your
local network. The IVT Platform supports direct integration with ONVIF-compatible cameras,
allowing you to add, configure, and monitor them for facial recognition and video surveillance.

<Note>
  ONVIF is an industry standard for IP-based security products. Most modern IP cameras from
  manufacturers such as Axis, Hikvision, Dahua, and Bosch support ONVIF profiles. Verify
  that your camera supports ONVIF Profile S (streaming) before adding it to the platform.
</Note>

## Adding a New ONVIF Camera

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to ONVIF Cameras">
    Go to **Cameras > ONVIF** from the main navigation menu and click the **Add Camera** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Camera Details">
    Provide the basic information for the camera:
    - **Camera name** -- a descriptive label for easy identification
    - **Description** (optional) -- additional notes about the camera's purpose or location
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Connection Settings">
    Enter the network connection parameters:
    - **IP Address** -- the local network IP address of the camera
    - **Port** -- the ONVIF service port (typically `80` or `8080`)
    - **Username** -- the camera's authentication username
    - **Password** -- the camera's authentication password
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure RTSP Stream">
    Specify the RTSP stream URL for the camera feed. This is typically in the format:
    ```
    rtsp://<ip>:<port>/stream1
    ```
    The exact path varies by camera manufacturer. Consult your camera's documentation for
    the correct RTSP URI.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test and Save">
    Click **Test Connection** to verify that the platform can reach the camera. If the
    test succeeds, click **Save** to add the camera to your inventory.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Ensure that the camera's IP address is reachable from the IVT Platform or the FMU device
  that will process the stream. Firewalls, VLANs, or network segmentation may prevent
  connectivity. Work with your network administrator to allow the required traffic.
</Warning>

## Configuring Camera Connection Settings

Each ONVIF camera requires proper network and credential configuration to function within the
platform.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Network Settings" icon="network-wired">
    Configure the camera's IP address and port. Use a static IP assignment on your network
    to prevent the camera from changing addresses after a DHCP renewal.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Authentication" icon="lock">
    Provide the username and password configured on the camera. These credentials are stored
    securely and used for ONVIF service calls and RTSP stream access.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## RTSP Stream Configuration

The Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is used to deliver video from the camera to the
IVT Platform and FMU devices. Proper RTSP configuration is critical for reliable video
processing.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Common RTSP Formats">
    | Manufacturer | Typical RTSP URL |
    |---|---|
    | Axis | `rtsp://<ip>/axis-media/media.amp` |
    | Hikvision | `rtsp://<ip>:554/Streaming/Channels/101` |
    | Dahua | `rtsp://<ip>:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=0` |
    | Generic ONVIF | `rtsp://<ip>:<port>/stream1` |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Stream Parameters">
    - **Resolution** -- use the highest resolution supported for optimal facial recognition
    - **Frame rate** -- a minimum of 15 fps is recommended; 30 fps is ideal
    - **Codec** -- H.264 is widely supported and recommended for compatibility
    - **Bitrate** -- adjust based on available bandwidth; higher bitrates improve image quality
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  For facial recognition accuracy, position cameras at a height of 2 to 3 meters and angle
  them to capture faces at near-frontal view. Ensure adequate lighting at the camera location.
</Tip>

## Editing and Removing Cameras

### Editing a Camera

To modify an existing ONVIF camera configuration:

1. Navigate to **Cameras > ONVIF** and select the camera you want to edit.
2. Click the **Edit** button to open the configuration form.
3. Update the desired fields such as name, IP address, port, credentials, or RTSP URL.
4. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

### Removing a Camera

To remove an ONVIF camera from the platform:

1. Navigate to **Cameras > ONVIF** and select the camera.
2. Click the **Delete** or **Remove** button.
3. Confirm the removal in the dialog prompt.

<Warning>
  Removing a camera will stop all active streams and disable any detection rules associated
  with it. This action cannot be undone. Ensure that no critical monitoring workflows depend
  on the camera before removing it.
</Warning>

## Camera Health Monitoring

The IVT Platform tracks the health and status of each ONVIF camera to help you maintain
reliable surveillance coverage.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection Status">
    Indicates whether the platform can successfully reach the camera over the network.
    A healthy camera shows an **Online** status. If the camera becomes unreachable, the
    status changes to **Offline** and an alert may be generated.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Stream Health">
    Monitors the quality and continuity of the RTSP video stream. Dropped frames,
    excessive latency, or stream disconnections are flagged for review.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Errors">
    If the camera credentials are changed on the device without updating them in the
    IVT Platform, the connection will fail with an authentication error. Update the
    credentials in the camera configuration to resolve this.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  Regularly review camera health metrics in the dashboard to proactively identify
  and resolve connectivity issues before they impact your surveillance operations.
