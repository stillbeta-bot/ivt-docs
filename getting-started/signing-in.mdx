---

Once your account has been created and activated, you can sign in to the IVT Platform using your email and password. The platform uses token-based authentication to secure your session and supports persistent sessions so you can stay logged in across browser visits.

## Standard Login

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Login Page">
    Open your browser and go to the platform login URL provided by your organization. If your organization uses a white-labeled deployment, the URL and branding will reflect your company's identity (e.g., Verify, Eye-D, or Totalplay).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Your Credentials">
    On the login page, enter:
    - **Email Address** -- The email you registered with
    - **Password** -- Your account password

    Double-check that your email is typed correctly, including proper capitalization for the domain portion.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Remember Me (Optional)">
    Check the **Remember Me** option if you want the platform to keep you signed in between browser sessions. When enabled, your session token is stored locally and refreshed automatically, so you do not need to re-enter your credentials each time you return.

    <Warning>
      Only use the Remember Me option on personal or trusted devices. On shared or public computers, leave this option unchecked and log out when you are finished.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Sign In">
    Press the **Sign In** button. If your credentials are correct, you will be redirected to the platform dashboard. If your account belongs to multiple companies, you may be prompted to select which company context to enter.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Forgot Password

If you have forgotten your password, the platform provides a self-service reset flow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Forgot Password">
    On the login page, click the **Forgot Password?** link located below the password field.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Your Email">
    Provide the email address associated with your account. The platform will send a password reset link to this address.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Your Email">
    Open the password reset email and click the **Reset Password** link. This link is valid for a limited time, typically 60 minutes.

    <Tip>
      If the email does not arrive within a few minutes, check your spam or junk folder. Some corporate email filters may delay or block automated messages.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set a New Password">
    Enter your new password and confirm it. The new password must meet the platform's complexity requirements: minimum 8 characters with at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign In with Your New Password">
    After resetting your password, you are redirected to the login page. Enter your email and new password to access the platform.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How Authentication Works

The IVT Platform uses **token-based authentication** to secure your session. Understanding how this works helps explain session behavior and troubleshoot access issues.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Access Tokens">
    When you log in, the platform issues an **access token** that authorizes your API requests and page loads. This token:
    - Is included automatically in every request your browser makes to the platform
    - Has a short lifespan (typically 15-30 minutes) for security
    - Is refreshed transparently in the background using your refresh token

    You do not need to manage access tokens manually. The platform handles token issuance and renewal automatically.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Refresh Tokens">
    A **refresh token** is issued alongside your access token during login. It is used to obtain new access tokens without requiring you to re-enter your password.
    - If **Remember Me** is enabled, the refresh token persists across browser sessions
    - If **Remember Me** is not enabled, the refresh token expires when you close the browser
    - Refresh tokens have a longer lifespan but will eventually expire, requiring a fresh login
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Session Expiration">
    Your session will end under the following conditions:
    - You explicitly log out
    - Your refresh token expires (after prolonged inactivity or reaching its maximum lifespan)
    - An administrator revokes your session or deactivates your account
    - Your password is changed, which invalidates all active sessions

    When your session expires, you are redirected to the login page to re-authenticate.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Session Persistence

The **Remember Me** feature controls how your session is persisted:

| Setting | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Remember Me enabled** | Your session survives browser restarts. The refresh token is stored in persistent local storage and renewed automatically. You stay logged in until the token's maximum lifespan is reached or you log out. |
| **Remember Me disabled** | Your session ends when you close the browser. The refresh token is stored in session-only storage and is cleared when the browser window is closed. |

<Info>
  Regardless of the Remember Me setting, all sessions are subject to a maximum lifetime configured by your organization's administrator. After this period, you must re-authenticate even if the Remember Me option was enabled.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting Login Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Incorrect email or password">
    Verify that you are entering the correct email address, including proper casing. If you are unsure of your password, use the **Forgot Password** flow to reset it. After multiple failed attempts, your account may be temporarily locked for security.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Account is locked">
    After several consecutive failed login attempts, the platform temporarily locks your account to prevent unauthorized access. Wait 15-30 minutes and try again, or contact your administrator to unlock your account immediately.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Account is deactivated">
    If you see a message indicating that your account is deactivated, contact your Company Admin or Reseller Admin. Only an administrator can reactivate a deactivated account.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Email not verified">
    You cannot log in until your email address is verified. Check your inbox for the original verification email, or use the **Resend Verification** link on the login page to request a new one.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Session keeps expiring unexpectedly">
    This may happen if your browser clears cookies or local storage on exit. Check your browser privacy settings and ensure that the platform domain is not subject to automatic data clearing. You can also enable **Remember Me** for longer session persistence.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Redirected to the wrong portal or brand">
    If you are seeing unfamiliar branding on the login page, you may have navigated to a different white-label portal. Confirm the correct login URL with your administrator and ensure you are accessing the portal assigned to your organization.
  </Accordion>
