## Overview

Zones are geofenced areas within the IVT Platform that define the physical boundaries where
detection and surveillance rules apply. Using an interactive Google Maps interface, you can
draw zone boundaries, assign cameras to specific areas, and configure location-based detection
rules. Zones provide geographic context for your surveillance operations and help organize
cameras by physical location.

<Note>
  Zones are essential for location-based alerting. By grouping cameras into zones, you can
  create targeted rules that only trigger within specific geographic areas, reducing noise
  and improving response accuracy.
</Note>

## Creating a New Zone

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Zones">
    Go to **Zones** from the main navigation menu and click the **Create Zone** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Zone Details">
    Provide the following information for the new zone:
    - **Zone name** -- a descriptive label (e.g., "Main Entrance", "Parking Lot B")
    - **Description** (optional) -- additional context about the zone's purpose
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Zone Boundaries on the Map">
    Use the interactive Google Maps interface to draw the zone boundary:
    1. Click on the map to place boundary points around the area you want to define.
    2. Each click adds a vertex to the polygon shape.
    3. Close the polygon by clicking on the first point or using the **Complete** button.
    4. Adjust the boundary by dragging individual points after placement.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Cameras to the Zone">
    Select the cameras that are physically located within or monitoring the zone. You can
    assign both Eagle Eye and ONVIF cameras to a zone.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Zone">
    Review the zone configuration and click **Save** to create the zone. The zone will
    appear on the map and in the zone list immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Defining Zone Boundaries

The map-based boundary editor provides a visual way to define the exact geographic area
covered by a zone.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Polygon Drawing" icon="draw-polygon">
    Click points on the map to create a polygon that outlines the zone boundary. The
    polygon can be any shape and include as many vertices as needed to match the area.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Boundary Adjustment" icon="arrows-up-down-left-right">
    After drawing, drag any vertex point to fine-tune the boundary. The polygon updates
    in real time as you adjust the shape.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Use the map's zoom controls to get a closer view when drawing boundaries for precise
  areas. Satellite view mode can help you align zone boundaries with physical structures
  like buildings, fences, and parking lots.
</Tip>

## Assigning Cameras to Zones

Cameras are linked to zones to establish which devices monitor a given area. When a camera is
assigned to a zone, all detections from that camera are associated with the zone's location.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="During Zone Creation">
    When creating a new zone, use the camera assignment step to select cameras from the
    available list. Only cameras that are not already assigned to another zone are shown.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="After Zone Creation">
    To assign cameras to an existing zone:
    1. Navigate to **Zones** and select the zone you want to modify.
    2. Click **Edit** and go to the camera assignment section.
    3. Add or remove cameras as needed.
    4. Click **Save** to apply the changes.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  A camera can only be assigned to one zone at a time. If you need to reassign a camera,
  remove it from its current zone first, then add it to the new zone.
</Info>

## Zone-Based Detection Rules

Zones enable location-aware detection rules that target specific areas of your operation.
When configuring detection rules, you can scope them to one or more zones so that alerts
are only generated for events within the defined boundaries.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Restricted Area Monitoring">
    Define a zone around a sensitive area and configure rules to alert when an unrecognized
    individual is detected by cameras within that zone.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Entry and Exit Tracking">
    Create zones at entry and exit points to track the movement of recognized individuals
    as they move between different areas of your facility.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Time-Based Zone Rules">
    Combine zone-based rules with time schedules to activate detection only during specific
    hours, such as after-hours monitoring for restricted areas.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Editing and Deleting Zones

### Editing a Zone

To modify an existing zone:

1. Navigate to **Zones** and select the zone from the list or map.
2. Click **Edit** to open the zone configuration.
3. Update the name, description, boundaries, or camera assignments.
4. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

### Deleting a Zone

To remove a zone from the platform:

1. Navigate to **Zones** and select the zone you want to delete.
2. Click the **Delete** button.
3. Confirm the deletion in the dialog prompt.

<Warning>
  Deleting a zone will remove all camera-to-zone associations and disable any detection
  rules that reference the zone. Cameras previously assigned to the zone will become
  unassigned and must be reassigned to another zone if needed.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Before deleting a zone, review the detection rules that reference it. Update or reassign
  those rules to prevent gaps in your surveillance coverage.
