## Overview

Eagle Eye Networks cameras are cloud-connected video surveillance devices managed through the
Eagle Eye Networks platform. The IVT Platform integrates directly with Eagle Eye Networks,
allowing you to monitor camera feeds, track device status, and leverage cloud-based video
streams for facial recognition and detection workflows.

<Note>
  Eagle Eye cameras are managed through the Eagle Eye Networks cloud platform. The IVT Platform
  pulls camera data and streams from your connected Eagle Eye account. Camera provisioning and
  network configuration are handled within Eagle Eye Networks directly.
</Note>

## Viewing Connected Cameras

All Eagle Eye cameras linked to your account are displayed in the **Cameras > Eagle Eye** section.
Each camera entry shows:

- **Camera name** -- the display name assigned in Eagle Eye Networks
- **Camera ID** -- the unique identifier from Eagle Eye Networks
- **Status** -- current connectivity state (online, offline, or error)
- **Location** -- the physical location or zone assignment
- **Last seen** -- timestamp of the most recent activity

<Tip>
  Use the search and filter controls at the top of the camera list to quickly locate specific
  cameras by name, status, or assigned zone.
</Tip>

## Camera Status Monitoring

The IVT Platform continuously monitors the health and connectivity of your Eagle Eye cameras.
Status indicators provide real-time feedback on each device.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Online" icon="circle-check">
    The camera is connected and streaming successfully. Video feeds are available for
    viewing and processing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Offline" icon="circle-xmark">
    The camera is not reachable. This may indicate a network issue, power loss, or a
    problem with the Eagle Eye Networks connection.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Error" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    The camera is experiencing a fault condition. Check the Eagle Eye Networks dashboard
    for detailed diagnostics.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  If a camera remains offline for an extended period, facial recognition and detection
  rules associated with that camera will not execute. Verify the camera's network
  connectivity and Eagle Eye account status.
</Warning>

## Stream Viewing

You can view live and recorded video streams from your Eagle Eye cameras directly within the
IVT Platform.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Eagle Eye Cameras">
    Go to **Cameras > Eagle Eye** from the main navigation menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a Camera">
    Click on a camera from the list to open its detail view.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View the Stream">
    The camera detail panel displays the live video feed. Use the playback controls to
    pause, rewind, or jump to a specific time if recorded footage is available.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Stream quality and availability depend on your Eagle Eye Networks subscription plan and the
  camera's current bandwidth. High-resolution streams may require a stable network connection.

## Integration with Eagle Eye Networks

The IVT Platform connects to Eagle Eye Networks through a secure API integration. This
connection enables the platform to:

- **Discover cameras** automatically from your Eagle Eye account
- **Pull live video streams** for real-time monitoring and facial recognition
- **Retrieve recorded footage** for post-event analysis and search
- **Sync camera metadata** including names, locations, and configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is the connection established?">
    Your IVT Platform account is linked to Eagle Eye Networks during the initial setup process.
    An administrator configures the Eagle Eye API credentials, and the platform authenticates
    using OAuth to maintain a persistent connection.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I add or remove cameras from the IVT Platform?">
    Camera inventory is managed within Eagle Eye Networks. Adding or removing a camera in your
    Eagle Eye account will automatically reflect in the IVT Platform after synchronization.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if the Eagle Eye connection is lost?">
    If the API connection to Eagle Eye Networks is interrupted, camera streams and status
    updates will become unavailable in the IVT Platform. Detection rules relying on these
    cameras will be paused until the connection is restored. Contact your administrator
    to re-establish the integration.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Assigning Cameras to Zones

Eagle Eye cameras can be assigned to detection zones to enable location-based facial recognition
and alerting. See the [Zone Management](/features/zones) documentation for details on creating
zones and assigning cameras.

<Tip>
  Assigning cameras to specific zones allows you to create targeted detection rules that only
  trigger for cameras within a defined geographic area, reducing false positives and improving
  operational focus.
