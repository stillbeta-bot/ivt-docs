The Release Notes page provides a chronological record of all IVT Platform updates, including new features, improvements, bug fixes, and breaking changes. Access release notes at `/system/release-notes` in any portal — company, distributor, or reseller.

## Overview

Release notes are managed through a headless CMS (Strapi) and published directly to the platform. This ensures content is always up to date and can be maintained by the product team without requiring a code deployment.

## Browsing Release Notes

Release notes are organized by version number and release date, with the most recent update displayed first. Each entry includes:

- **Version number** — Semantic versioning format (e.g., `v3.12.0`)
- **Release date** — The date the update was deployed to production
- **Category tags** — Labels indicating the type of changes (feature, improvement, fix, security, breaking change)
- **Summary** — A concise description of the update and its impact
- **Detailed changelog** — A full breakdown of individual changes included in the release

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Release Notes">
    Go to **System > Release Notes** from the sidebar navigation in any portal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Browse or search entries">
    Scroll through the chronological list or use the search bar to find release notes by keyword, version number, or feature name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter by category">
    Use the category filter to view only specific types of changes — features, improvements, bug fixes, or security updates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Expand entry details">
    Click on any release note entry to expand the full changelog and view individual line items with their descriptions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Version History

The version history section provides a complete archive of all past releases. Use the timeline navigation to jump to a specific version or date range.

<Tip>
  Bookmark specific release notes by copying the URL with the version anchor (e.g., `/system/release-notes#v3.12.0`) for easy reference in support tickets or team communications.
</Tip>

## CMS-Powered Content

Release note content is authored and managed through Strapi, the platform's headless CMS. This architecture provides several benefits:

- **Rich formatting** — Release notes support headings, lists, code blocks, images, and embedded media
- **Scheduled publishing** — Entries can be drafted and scheduled for publication alongside a deployment
- **Revision history** — All content changes are tracked within the CMS for audit purposes
- **Multi-portal delivery** — A single release note can be published to all portals simultaneously or targeted to specific portal types

<Note>
  Release note content is cached on the client side for performance. New entries may take up to 5 minutes to appear after publication. Use a hard refresh to force an immediate update.
</Note>

## Role-Based Visibility

Not all release notes are visible to every user. The CMS supports role-based visibility controls:

| Audience | Visible Content |
|---|---|
| Company Users | General features, bug fixes, and improvements relevant to end-user workflows |
| Distributor Admins | All company-visible content plus distributor management updates and API changes |
| Reseller Admins | All distributor-visible content plus reseller billing, licensing, and partner program updates |
| Platform Admins | Full visibility including internal platform changes, infrastructure updates, and migration notes |

<Info>
  Breaking changes are highlighted with a prominent banner and are visible to all roles that may be affected. These entries include migration guides and action items where applicable.

## Subscribing to Update Notifications
